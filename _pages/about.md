I am a final year undergraduate student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa Campus, pursuing Computer Science and Engineering as my major. My research interests lie in Deep Learning, particularly in it's applications in cognitive neuroscience and other fields.

Currently I am collaborating remotely with the IAS Lab at TU Darmstadt on segmenting human actions, and with the Serre Lab at Brown University on visual reasoning in progressive matrices. Further details about my research work can be found in the [Research](https://rijul1999.github.io/categories/) section.
