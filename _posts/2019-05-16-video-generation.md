This was a past project, involving using Generative Adverserial Networks(GANs) on videos. The main aim was to use the [Cooking Dataset](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/human-activity-recognition/mpii-cooking-2-dataset/) provided by the Max Planck Institute, and attempt to generate the future frames of the video from the original. The final result we obtained was able to successfully generate frames of the video, however the resolution of the obtained video was much reduced.
