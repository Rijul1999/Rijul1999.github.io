[Playground](https://github.com/SforAiDl/Playground) is a python library built for the purpose of sports analytics using deep learning. I am one of the contributors to the library. Currently we have a framework built for analytics of Badminton, with Football and Cricket on the way. As part of the work on this library, we also submitted a paper to the [MLSA 2020](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/events/MLSA20/) workshop, and are awaiting review of the paper.
