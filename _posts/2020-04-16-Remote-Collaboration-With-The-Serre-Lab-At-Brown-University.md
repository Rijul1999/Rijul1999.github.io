Currently I am working with the [Serre Lab](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/) at Brown University as a remote collaborator. My current project involves applying meta learning to progressive matrices such as RAVEN or PGM. Current state of the art methods for solving these matrices exhibit really poor generalization capacity, when it comes to unseen rules or unseen image configurations. We are aiming to solve this problem through our method.
