I am currently working with [Julen Urain](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JulenUrainDeJesus) at TU Darmstdat as part of a remote collaboration. Our topic of interect is segmentation of action in humans. We are working on using neural networks to attempt to classify motion trajectories into specific actions such as pick up an object, or go to an object. Our final aim is to use this network in a robot which will be able to mimic human actions near perfectly.
