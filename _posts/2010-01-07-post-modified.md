I was one of the instructors for the course Deep Learning for Computer Vision, conducted by the Center for Technical Education at my university. The main aim for the course was to introduce slightly more advanced concepts and state of the art papers in computer vision to people who were already somewhat familiar with the basics of machine learning.
