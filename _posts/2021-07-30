Currently I am working in Amazon as an SDE-1 in the SFT organization under the LocalShops team. My major projects thus far has been:

1) Worked on a project on processing data sent by a ML model, and then sending warning/restriction emails to sellers accordingly

2) Am currently leading a project to overhaul a major feature for sellers, which will enable faster and easier signing up for a new service we have launched.

3) Worked on expanding our packages and features to multiple marketplaces beyond IN.
