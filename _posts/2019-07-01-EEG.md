This project was done under [Professor Veeky Baths](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/veeky/profile). The major idea here was to treat the Electroencephalographic Waves obtained from the brain as images, and pass them through a convolutional neural network to observe whether we could obtain any insights as to whether they could be useful for extracting emotions. We used the [DEAP](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) dataset for this purpose, and we tried to predict the Valence and Arousal values from the waves. They were each split into 4 classes based on the range of values where they each belonged to. We obtained an accuracy of 70% for Valence and 65% for Arousal.
